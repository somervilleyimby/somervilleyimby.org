* Also from AHMA, "[Meet Michael and Iris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eazbs2p6-hIurl)," introducing the concept of abundant housing and why it matters to people you might know.
* From the Sightline Institute: [Cruel Musical Chairs (or Why is the Rent So High?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGQU0T6NBc) uses a twisted game of musical chairs to illustrate why housing abundance matters.
* From the Urban Institute: [Zoning Matters: How Land Use Policies Shape Our Lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLMsI92crZw).
* UC Berkeley's Terner Center for Housing Innovation has an awesome simulation called [Demystifying Development Math](https://www.ternercenter.app/demystifying-development-math) that helps illustrate how housing construction is financed (or not).  

## Other Research
