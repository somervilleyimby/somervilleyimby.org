Please join us in addressing the housing affordability crisis! Our main organizing platform is [our Discourse](https://discourse.somervilleyimby.org/). It is available through the site, and can optionally be delivered to your inbox.

We also have a Discord server if you wan to be _even more involved!_ The invite link is available after joining the main Discourse web forum, look for the Discord icon in the top-right, next to the search icon.

And yes, those names are confusing! Nothing to be done about it, unfortunately.

Typically, we have an in-person social, see [our calendar](/calendar/) for more information.
